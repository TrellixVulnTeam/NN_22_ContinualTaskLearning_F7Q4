# @title Set random seed

# @markdown Executing `set_seed(seed=seed)` you are setting the seed

# for DL its critical to set the random seed so that students can have a
# baseline to compare their results to expected results.
# Read more here: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/randomness.html

# Call `set_seed` function in the exercises to ensure reproducibility.

      If `True` sets the random seed for pytorch tensors, so pytorch module
